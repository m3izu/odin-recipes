    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>

            Rub skin with butter, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 cups of turkey stock into the roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Loosely tent turkey with aluminum foil, and roast turkey for 2 1/2 hours, basting with pan juices every 30 minutes. 
            When drippings evaporate, add remaining stock to the pan, 1 to 2 cups at a time.</li>
        <li>Remove foil and continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh reads 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours more.</li>
